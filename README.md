# PassLocker
128bit AES password manager for the android platform. Uses the dropbox datastore API for synchronization across devices. Project was built as a project for college project. This project was my first attempt at building an Android application. 

As of April 29, 2016, the DataStore API will no longer be supported by Dropbox, which will cause this application to fail if user links the application with their Dropbox account.
